\section{About}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{3cm}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{me}
\end{wrapfigure}

Dedicated and hands-on engineering \& project lead, with 13 years of practical experience in hardware and IIot product development, including firmware, QA, electronics and mechanical design taking early concepts to manufacturing at scale. Leading cross-functional agile teams (up to 13 engineers) with a strong focus on self-reliance, dependability and quality. I believe building an audacious engineering team and product backlog is the key to bringing research, design as well as development projects to a fulfilling completion. The values I share with my teams are thriving for open communication, building trust, honouring our commitments, understanding the what and why before defining the how to ensure we are doing the right things the right way, and embracing challenges for what they can teach us.

    I have the pleasure to lead an agile team of eleven exceptional electronics, mechanics, embedded software and QA engineers as well as fullstack and backend developers. Together, we built a strong and efficient cross-functional product engineering team and take ownership for the entire lifecycle of our hardware portfolio and the backend interfaces they rely on. I provide the team with a hardware and software vision and roadmap (1-2 years ahead) as well as extensive product backlogs. Then, I accompany them through concept, design, prototyping, execution and validation, until the final deliveries to our production partners. At the company level, I represent our hardware engineering efforts and ensure alignments with our Product, Sales and Customer Success, as well as System Operations teams. I am thrilled to be able to mentor each individual contributor, both on technical aspects as well as personal growth.

    I joined a young and dynamic team of electronics and embedded software developers as a validation engineer. I quickly took on the role of team lead as our need to develop a new product became a financial imperative for the company. Growing the team evenly from 5 to 13 engineers over the course of 18 months enabled us, in March 2019, to release a very successful product in both Europe and North America while still being able to work on other innovation projects. ProGlove went on to become an extremely successful company, with its lighthouse product being the product I had the pleasure to bring to completion.

    Starting in 2011 as a validation and verification engineer, and eventually completing my Master's thesis within the Analog Design department, I took an interest in refining and streamlining our internal tooling used for pre-silicon and post-silicon validation of both the analog design as well as the embedded firmware and signal processing leading me to work as a embedded software verification engineer. In 2015, I enlisted the help of a scrum master, in order to bring multiple software and hardware engineering teams together to solve a unique problem in the analog semiconductor world: how to build a system where emulation and real hardware can be validated using the same test vectors and test cases. The team was scattered across Europe and the United States and were organised in feature teams.
