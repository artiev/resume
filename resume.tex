\section{About}

\begin{minipage}{0.79\textwidth}
  Dedicated and hands-on engineering \& project manager, with 13 years of experience in hardware and IIot product development taking early concepts to manufacturing at scale, leading firmware, QA, electronics, mechanical design and backend engineering. Building cross-functional agile teams (up to 13 engineers) with a strong focus on self-reliance, dependability and quality. I believe building an audacious engineering team and product backlog is the key to bringing research, design as well as development projects to a fulfilling completion. The values I instil in my teams are thriving for open communication, building trust, honouring our commitments, understanding the what and why before defining the how to ensure we are doing the right things the right way, and embracing challenges for what they can teach us.

  I have the pleasure of leading an agile team of eleven exceptional electronics, mechanics, embedded software and QA engineers, as well as full-stack and backend developers. Together, we built a strong and efficient cross-functional product engineering team and took ownership of the entire lifecycle of our hardware portfolio and the backend interfaces they rely on. I provide the team with a hardware and software vision and roadmap (1-2 years ahead) as well as extensive product backlogs. Then, I accompany them through concept, design, prototyping, execution and validation until the final deliveries to our manufacturing partners. At the company level, I represent our hardware engineering efforts and ensure alignments with our Product, Sales, Customer Success, as well as Operations teams. I am thrilled to be able to mentor each individual contributor, both on technical aspects and personal growth.

  Joining a young and dynamic team of electronics and embedded software developers as a validation engineer, I quickly took on the role of team lead as our need to develop a new product became a financial imperative for the company. Growing the team evenly from 5 to 13 engineers over the course of 18 months enabled us, in March 2019, to release our most successful product in both Europe and North America while still being able to work on other innovation projects. ProGlove went on to become an extremely profitable company, with its lighthouse product being the device and technology I had the pleasure to pioneer.

  Starting in 2011 as a validation and verification engineer, and later completing my Master's thesis within the Analog Design department, I took an interest in refining and streamlining our pre-silicon and post-silicon validation pipelines, leading me to join the embedded software verification team within the transceiver design department. In 2015, I enlisted the help of a scrum master, combining multiple software and hardware engineers distributed across Europe and the United States to solve a unique challenge in the semiconductor world: how to build a test automation system where emulation and real hardware can be validated using the same test vectors and test cases.

\section{Extracurricular}

  \makehobbyparagraph{Ultralight Outdoor Equipment Design \& Manufacturing}
  {\href{https://abcpacks.com}{ABC Packs}}
  {For the last 6 years, I have regularly designed various types of backpacks and rucksacks with the goal of massively reducing the weight and volume of outdoor equipment one can carry on treks, expeditions, ski touring, etc. I take orders, design unique pieces of equipment sometimes with the customer, then manufacture, ship and bill my creations. To that end, I research and use high-performance materials and fabrics, and always push the limits of what I can execute.}
  
  \makehobbyparagraph{Hand-tool Woodworking \& Furniture Making}
  {}
  {I find wood to be a fascinating material to shape and build with. The steep learning curve requires a lot of patience and repetition to build muscle memory. After about 4 years of practice, I am only now starting to feel comfortable designing more complex and ambitious pieces of furniture.}

  \makehobbyparagraph{Long Distance Hiking \& Solo expeditions}
  {}
  {I have trekked for weeks at a time in the Himalayas and in Swedish Lapland, hiked all around the European Alps from France to Romania, walked the Great Glen Way in 4 days, and hiked part of the Adler Weg which I still need to complete.}

  \makehobbyparagraph{Outdoor \& Street Photography}
  {}
  {I started my journey into photography about 15 years ago, and shot both film and digital cameras during this time. I simply enjoy the process of creating a still image of a slice of life.}
